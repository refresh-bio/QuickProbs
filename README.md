# QuickProbs

QuickProbs is an algorithm for multiple sequence alignment. Based on probabilistic models, equipped with novel column-oriented refinement and selective consistency, it offers outstanding accuracy for protein families ranging from few, to hundreds of sequences. Due to algorithmic improvements and utilisation of massively parallel architectures it is also very fast. Particularly, it allows high-quality alignments of thousand of sequences to be calculated in less than a minute, which was out of range for any previously published alignment software. Additional facilities like nucleotide mode or bulk processing further extend QuickProbs usability.
